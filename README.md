# Unity-Playground

Greetings, program! 

The Unity projects I work on can get pretty complex and contain a ton of distracting pieces. I created this repository, so that I would have a clean and empty Unity workspace where nothing can distract me.

I use this project during challenging tasks at work-related or personal Unity projects
